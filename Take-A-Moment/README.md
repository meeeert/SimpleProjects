## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. It’s like the bread and butter for your app!

### First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the magic unfold.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.jsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file—no need to refresh and lose your train of thought!

### Font Optimization

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font. Because who doesn’t want their text to look snazzy?
