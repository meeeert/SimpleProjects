Law 1:
If a tenant damages the property beyond normal wear and tear, the landlord is entitled to deduct the cost of repairs from the security deposit and may seek additional compensation if the damage exceeds the deposit.

Example Case:
A tenant left large holes in the walls after removing mounted TVs, and the damage exceeded the security deposit by $2,000. The landlord successfully sued the tenant for the extra amount in small claims court.

Law 2:
A tenant who is consistently late on rent for three consecutive months may face eviction if written warnings have been issued each time.

Example Case:
A tenant paid rent late for four straight months despite three warnings. The landlord filed for eviction, and the court granted the landlord the right to reclaim the property within 30 days.

Law 3:
Landlords must provide at least 72 hours' notice before entering a rental unit, unless there is an emergency.

Example Case:
A landlord entered a tenant's apartment without notice for non-urgent repairs, and the tenant sued for privacy violations. The court awarded the tenant $1,000 for breach of the notice requirement.
