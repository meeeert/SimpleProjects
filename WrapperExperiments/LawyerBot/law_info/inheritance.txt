Law 1:
If a person dies intestate (without a will), their spouse inherits 50% of their estate, and the remaining 50% is divided equally among their children.

Example Case:
A man passed away without a will, leaving behind his wife and three children. The wife received half of the estate, while the remaining half was equally distributed among the children, each receiving 16.67%.

Law 2:
A parent who has abandoned their child for more than 5 years is disqualified from inheriting from that child’s estate unless they have resumed significant contact.

Example Case:
A father who abandoned his son for over a decade attempted to claim inheritance after the son passed away. The court ruled that the father was ineligible to inherit, and the estate was distributed to the son’s siblings.

Law 3:
A beneficiary who is proven to have coerced the testator into changing their will may lose all rights to the inheritance.

Example Case:
A woman coerced her elderly aunt into altering her will to leave her the entire estate. After the aunt’s death, the woman’s cousins contested the will, and the court revoked the woman’s inheritance due to undue influence.
