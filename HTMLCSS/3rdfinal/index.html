        <p>Charles Darwin was an English naturalist, geologist, and biologist.</p>
        <p>His contributions have significantly impacted modern science.</p>
        <p>Darwin's theory of evolution is considered a cornerstone of biological sciences.</p>
        <p>He was born in Shrewsbury, England, in 1809.</p>
        <p>Darwin's work remains influential today.</p>

        <p>Darwin was born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England.</p>
        <p>He was the fifth of six children in his family.</p>
        <p>Darwin's early education was at the Shrewsbury School.</p>
        <p>He later attended the University of Edinburgh.</p>
        <p>Darwin was initially interested in medicine but shifted to natural history.</p>

        <p>Darwin embarked on a journey aboard the HMS Beagle.</p>
        <p>The voyage lasted from 1831 to 1836.</p>
        <p>During the voyage, Darwin collected numerous specimens and observations.</p>
        <p>He visited various locations including the Galapagos Islands.</p>
        <p>The findings from the voyage significantly influenced his scientific views.</p>

        <p>Darwin formulated his theory of evolution by natural selection.</p>
        <p>His work was published in "On the Origin of Species" in 1859.</p>
        <p>The theory suggests that species evolve over time through natural selection.</p>
        <p>Darwin's ideas were initially controversial but gained widespread acceptance.</p>
        <p>The theory has been foundational in modern evolutionary biology.</p>

        <p>Darwin's work has had a lasting impact on science and society.</p>
        <p>His theories continue to influence various fields of study.</p>
        <p>Darwin is remembered as one of the most important scientists in history.</p>
        <p>His ideas paved the way for the modern understanding of genetics and evolution.</p>
